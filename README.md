# Scribe-Smart

This project is a web application designed to facilitate note-taking and transcription for users. It allows users to record their spoken responses to predefined questions, transcribe them into text, and edit the transcriptions as needed. Users can also highlight text, navigate through sentences, and save their changes. Additionally, the application provides text-to-speech functionality for both questions and recorded answers. Finally, it offers a feature to generate a PDF document containing all the questions and their corresponding answers entered by the user.
